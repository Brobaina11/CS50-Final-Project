### Description 

Hello guys and welcome to my iOS Notepad. This app is a simple note taking app for iOS written in Swift that allows users to write, edit and delete tasks with a date that corresponds with the task. After writing a task and choosing a date from a calender to correspond with it, users can then save the task. After saving the task via the save button on the top right of the phone, users will then return back to the main display that shows the task or note the user wrote and the date that corresponded with the note of the users choice. Users can then click on whichever note they wrote and are more than welcome to delete the note. Users can write, save and delete as many notes as they prefer.

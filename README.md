### Description 

Hello guys and welcome to my iOS Notepad app. This app is a simple note taking app for iOS written in Swift that allows users to write, edit and delete tasks or any writing of their choice. After writing a task or note, users can then save the note. After saving the note via the save button on the top right of the phone, users will then return back to the main display that shows the note the user wrote. Users can then click on whichever note they wrote and are more than welcome to delete the note. Users can write, save and delete as many notes as they prefer.
